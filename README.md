# Image Analysis Assistant

The UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) technology is nowadays used equally effectively for both military and civilian purposes. Cameras are one of the most significant UAV features since the middle of 20th century. The amount of the data which operator needs to handle has increased with the increase of processors computing power. The operators become helpless in front of a huge number of images which need to be processed and valuable information extracted. Algorithms and methods for 2D and 3D image analysis have been described. Methods include 2D and 3D segmentation, geocoding and change detection. Lack of depth information and different lighting as well as shadow problem are making 2D image processing difficult. An overview of image segmentation methods based on local and global thresholds is given, as well as a comparative analysis of the implemented methods. The problem of 3D environment model reconstruction from a set of 2D images acquired by the UAV is described and the method for segmentation of 3D model is implemented. In this paper the novel color-based 2D image segmentation algorithm is introduced. The model is based on modeling lighting impact to 2D images using neural networks. The results show that good results for 2D image segmentation can be achieved for simpler classes, but also the complexity of the problem for segmenting more complex object on the stage as well as the advantages of using 3D segmentation.
