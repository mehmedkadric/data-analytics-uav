# Image Analysis Assistant
## About
The Image Analysis Assistant is a tool designed to address the challenges posed by the ever-growing volume of image data captured by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for both military and civilian applications. With UAV technology becoming increasingly sophisticated, the role of cameras in data collection has become pivotal since the mid-20th century. However, the surge in processing power has led to a flood of images, overwhelming operators who need to extract valuable insights from this data.

This repository offers algorithms and methods for 2D and 3D image analysis. It delves into techniques like segmentation, geocoding, and change detection in both 2D and 3D domains. Despite the challenges posed by factors such as lack of depth information, varying lighting conditions, and shadows, the provided methods tackle these complexities.

The README highlights an array of topics, including:

- Image segmentation methods based on local and global thresholds, along with a comparative analysis of these approaches.
- A solution to the 3D environment model reconstruction challenge, using a set of 2D images obtained from UAVs.
- Introduction to a novel color-based 2D image segmentation algorithm leveraging neural networks to model lighting effects in images.
- Insights into the capabilities and complexities of segmenting objects of different levels of complexity, while also touching on the merits of 3D segmentation.

Feel free to explore the content here to gain a deeper understanding of UAV image analysis and its innovative solutions.
